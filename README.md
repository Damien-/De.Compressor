De.Compressor
=============

This project was in my first year of university in C programming language. We were team of 3,
and we had to make a simple compressor and decompressor with GUI. The application uses several 
methods of compression such as static Huffman, deflate(LZW + dynamic Huffman), and just LZW.

I mostly worked on the GUI and API to interact with filesystem, but everybody was involved on 
every part of the project.
